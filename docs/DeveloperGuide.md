## Setting up PlanNUS

First and foremost, the following steps are assuming that you already have a [GitHub](github.com) account set up beforehand. Once this has been done, proceed to __fork__ this [repo](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-1/tp), and __clone__ the fork into your computer using [Sourcetree](<sourcetreeapp.com>) or any other _Git GUI_.

The _IDE_ to be used should contain the latest version of _Java_ as this is the main programming language for this application. Thus you are highly recommended to use Intellij IDEA.

The following are remaining steps to be taken to finish the set up:

1. Make sure that the version is configured as __JDK 11__.
2. When prompted, __import__ the project as a __Gradle project__ (could take minutes to complete).
3. Enter commands to ensure that PlanNUS functions as expected. You may refer to the _User Guide_ for valid commands.

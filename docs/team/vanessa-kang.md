## Project: PlanNUS

PlanNUS is a greenfield, CLI-based project which aims to solve the gap in undergraduate academic planning in NUS. PlanNUS aims to remove the need for Excel sheets and CAP calculator websites by bundling their functionalities, and more, into two key apps: the _Academic Planner_ and _CAP Calculator_.

The _Academic Planner_ assists students in planning out their academic calendar for the entire duration (4-5 years) of their NUS candidature. It provides students with a convenient interface to keep track of the modules that they have taken, or are planning to take, along with the associated semester and grade information. 

The _CAP Calculator_ then makes use of this existing data to calculate students' current CAP. This helps students to accurately monitor, and even forecast, their academic performance.
